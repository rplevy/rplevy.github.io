    <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I am a highly experienced software engineer specializing in
   functional and data-oriented programming (professional Clojure
   developer since 2010) and AI / machine learning. My strengths
   include designing, implementing, and maintaining robust and
   scalable systems, and solving complex technical challenges that
   demand leadership, collaboration, and communication skills. I have
   achieved success in building and delivering high-impact feature
   sets and products such as LLM-based summarization and ranking for
   malware threats at Cisco, a custom payouts system at Starcity, and
   TalkIQ's real-time intelligence augmentation interface for sales
   reps and customer service agents.</p>

  <p>My fascination with software development started early, with my
   childhood love of computer programming. I began programming in
   BASIC on a Commodore 64, later moving on to QuickBasic and
   Pascal. When choosing a college, I was drawn to SUNY Oswego's
   multi-disciplinary cognitive science program. I became their first
   cognitive science graduate, and my thesis was an AI model of
   creativity using recurrent neural nets.  Initially I worked
   primarily in Perl, Python, and PHP, striving for simple, readable,
   and expressive code. Inspired by Common Lisp and the works of Paul
   Graham, I embraced functional programming in Perl. I'm drawn to
   functional and data-oriented programming because it empowers
   programmers to be more expressive and productive. This focus on
   expressiveness, alongside my interest in ergonomic design and AI
   augmenting the intelligence of users, has been a recurring theme in
   my career.</p>

  <p>The 2010s saw Clojure becoming central to my work. I love its
   pragmatism, simplicity, expressive power owing to its immutable
   data structures and functional idiom, and robust production-quality
   performance. I grew my expertise in distributed systems software
   architecture, through a series of substantive experiences building
   service-oriented architectures with REST, GraphQL, and Kafka, and I
   continue to learn and deepen my skill set in this area of
   interest. I likewise honed my front-end skills, as an early adopter
   of ClojureScript and using React, Reagent, Re-frame, Om, and
   Node.js. My passion for machine learning and AI continues, both
   professionally and personally. More details on my professional
   achievements can be found in the work experience sections of my
   resume.</p>

  <p>I am open to new opportunities and I am excited about
    contributing to a team that is pushing the boundaries of applying
    generative AI technology in my next role. Please feel free to
