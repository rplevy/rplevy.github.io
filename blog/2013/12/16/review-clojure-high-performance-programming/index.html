<div class="entry-content"><p>If you happen to be a software engineer who uses Clojure in production or in any serious capacity, I would recommend getting a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Performance-Programming-Shantanu-Kumar/dp/1782165606/ref=cm_cr-mr-title">&ldquo;Clojure High Performance Programming&rdquo; by Shantanu Kumar</a> (2013, Packt Publishing). A valid worry when discovering any new Clojure book is, will it be &ldquo;yet another Clojure beginner book&rdquo;? The answer to that question in this case is almost definitely a &ldquo;no&rdquo;, however for the hardcore JVM performance expert it may be a little slow-moving. From my perspective however, as someone who has had several years of experience developing high-performance distributed systems in Clojure, I found it to be quite valuable and informative. The book is a short but consistently high-quality 133 pages of substantive facts, useful reference tables, and accessible documentation of contemporary best practices for high-performance design, optimization, and profiling. As one might expect from the title, it is thoroughly grounded in real-world practice; there are only a few Clojure books in that category, and I would venture to say that this one is the best yet (as far as Clojure books <em>in general</em> go, The Joy of Clojure is the best book-length articulation of the Clojure idiom).</p>

<p>The first chapter defines common terms as they are to be applied throughout the book, and also introduces a theme that is revisited throughout the book, of performance modeling, objectives, and planning as being of fundamental importance in developing high-performance systems. Chapter 2 explores the performance properties of Clojure-specific abstractions (including a great table of algorithmic complexities of common operations on Clojure&rsquo;s persistent data structures), whereas Chapter 3 does the same for Java-level abstractions. Chapter 4 presents an overview of modern hardware architecture followed by an in-depth discussion of the JVM, which leads into Chapter 5, the concurency chapter, which in addition to being the best performance-focused treatment on concurrency and parallelism in Clojure/Java I have seen in one place, might easily be the most thorough treatment of Clojure/Java concurrency and parallelism features and data structures I have seen, in one place. And not least of this is a discussion of reducers, a topic that for whatever reasons has not been explored much beyond Rich Hickey&rsquo;s somewhat opaque inaugural articles (I will admit to having used reducers, and having used them effectively, without fully understanding their implementation, much less Rich&rsquo;s masterplan&mdash; but I now have a somewhat better grasp of reducers). Chapter 6 and 7 explore performance analysis, optimization, and design at the unit, application, and system architectural levels.</p>

<p>The approaches described here are very much in keeping with my own experiences, but yet even where it was covering well-trodden ground, I found it valuable to read and learned a great deal. The bottom line is this book does a really good job of covering and conveying nuances of some interesting performance topics, and I think it is a great and much needed addition to the available selection of books on Clojure.</p>
